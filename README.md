# Data Science Portfolio by Joshua Susanto

This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks and projects for organizational and showcasing purposes. In this portfolio I hope to showcase my skills in data analysis as well as document my journey exploring different machine learning algorithms and areas of data science. Different projects are separated by categories and will have descriptions and links. Please feel free to reach out for any questions or elaboration!
